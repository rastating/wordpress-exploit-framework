# How to contribute
Contributions are always welcome, however, to keep things consistent, please review the following guidelines.

## Overcommit
This repository has Overcommit configured. It will run Rubocop before commiting and Rspec before Pushing to repository. Ensure You have overcommit configured by running: `overcommit --install`

## Update unit tests
If you change a core piece of functionality (i.e. in ```lib/wpxf/*```) then ensure the corresponding unit tests in the ```spec``` folder are updated.

For more information on writing unit tests with RSpec, see https://relishapp.com/rspec

## Ensure RuboCop approves
Unless there's good reason, there should be no [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) warnings for any code you submit a pull request for. There have been changes to the [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) configuration for this project to disable some rules and to increase the boundaries of some (such as line lengths), so when testing your files, ensure you're doing so using the ```.rubocop.yml``` found in the root directory.

## Provide instructions for testing new exploits and auxiliary modules
If you're sending a pull request for a new auxiliary or exploit module, provide some basic information on how to test it. This should include:

- If the module targets a plugin or theme, provide a link to the vulnerable plugin / theme
- If the module targets a specific version of WordPress, be clear which version or range it targets
- Provide links to reference material if available (e.g. WPVulnDB link)

## Target the development branch
When opening a pull request, compare with the ```development``` branch, rather than ```master```. The master branch is aimed at being equal to the latest stable release; meaning all staged changes need to go into the ```development``` branch.
